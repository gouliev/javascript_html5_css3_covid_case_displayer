INTRODUCTION
------------

This is my first javascript assignment ever created. I used HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript only as according 
    to the assignment 2 of COMP30640.
The submission files are dashboard.html, dashboard.js, stylesheet.css, about.html and aboutstyle.css

The website is similar to my first assignment 1, the front page was split into 2 sides
    (using div method) and the left side shows total covid numbers by week.
The right side of the website gives the user 3 options via a dropdown box, allowing user to select a county,
    The county once selected gives the user a number of confirmed covid cases for that county

I used resources online and in class lecture. All material is referenced. No code was reused/copied 
    from outside sources, only reviewed to see how methods, workarounds, and etc were done. 

I coded this in VS Code, and used packages such as Live Previewer (Port 5500) 
    this allowed me to see an interactive version with changes
I used Prettier, a package which does spacing and alignment automatically for me
I used spell codecheck and auto-syntax which are intelligence packages that allow spell checking for 
    common syntactical errors and finishing code tabulations, e.g. typing ! gives you a skeleton html 
            or typing di.. finishes div and creates a class where you simply enter its name.

I used many resources to complete this, mostly watching YouTube videos and tutorials,
The videos dealt with APIs, and fetch / loading JSON files and manipulating them:

1 JS file which contains the functionality
1. HTML file which contains the website itself
1. CSS file which contains the styling


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
I had some trouble with trying to get percentages, I have also included the codetesting.js which shows 
where I ran into trouble trying to create a;
    switch to allow the integer to turn into a float percentage but it did not work.
        This was not included in my assignment

I also did some things that I later learned are bad practice, such as formatting of variable names
It is good practice as I have noticed from looking at code tutorials to use camelCase to name variables
It is also good practice not to use the actual drop down boxes as placeholders or text explanations
I also made some errors as similar to the last assignment where I had formatting problems on the HTML:
    So I used <br> to space things out which is not ideal
